          { "text": "The Ethereum project aims to do for human collaboration what the internet did for information. It is part of a world computer, where everyone can publish and access content, write and use applications, send value and make agreements. This is done through so-called smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) - open, tamper-proof, opt-in, self-executing applications, that run exactly as programmed and all share one common, append-only 'truth' - the Ethereum blockchain, while ensuring that there is no downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference." },
          { "text": "This decentralized environment allows all people, programs, IoT devices, markets, registries and other things to collaborate without the need for explicit trust. That's why people also call it the trust machine, it is not just an upgrade to our databases or internet, but rather a tool to re-architect social, financial and political systems. The vision is one, where people are no longer the product, producer and property of content platforms, but are instead the contributors, curators and communicators of value." },
          { "text": "While that all just sounds a lot of awesome buzzwords, it is very actively developed by thousands of developers around the world and happening right now. Below you'll find many links to tutorials, instruction guides and videos, which will help you to get started. Welcome to the future." }
